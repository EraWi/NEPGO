# NEPGO - Android app

My job while developing this app was to create an Android application in which you can register/login into, make posts, see posts made by other users and customize your own profile.
Backend was already handled when I started working on the project. 

Technologies/tools used:

* Android Studio

* GitKraken & Bitbucket

* Retrofit 2

* Gson

* RecyclerView

* Glide
